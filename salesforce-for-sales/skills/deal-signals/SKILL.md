# Global Rules

- **Execute silently between tool calls.** Do not output planning, progress, transition, waiting, or tool-result narration between calls. Execute tool calls silently and proceed directly to the next call. Parallelize independent tasks by batching tool calls into one turn whenever possible. Before the final output, speak only when the skill explicitly requires user input, approval, an exact notice, or material error/blocked reporting. Do not invent checkpoints.
- **Keep the final output concise.** Return only the requested result or deliverable. Omit process recaps, tool-call details, redundant preambles or conclusions, and data already shown in a widget.
- **⛔ WIDGET OUTPUT ONLY after data assembly.** Once all queries return, immediately call `display_widget` — at most a single one-line render-wait notice before it, and no summaries, transitions, or narration. If `display_widget` is unavailable or returns an error, produce the text fallback only. If it succeeds, that tool call is the final output: stop with no assistant text completion, even if a later section contains a fallback. The exceptions above do not apply after success.
- **Ground dynamic or custom relationship and field names before relying on them.** Fixed standard fields that this skill explicitly marks as requiring no grounding need no extra grounding call. On a name error, use the skill's documented grounding path when present; otherwise report the error instead of guessing or re-firing the same shape.
- **Cite every value exactly as queried**; never fabricate; distinguish a blank value from a value that was not queried. Link each Salesforce record inline: `https://[instanceUrl]/lightning/r/[SObjectType]/[Id]/view`.
- **Show human labels, never API/field literals.** In anything the user sees, print each field's grounded `label` (for example, "Deal Risk", not `Deal_Risk__c`) and record Names, never raw Ids or `__c` API names.
- **Empty `MINE` scope → fail fast, then ask which scope.** If a `scope: MINE` read returns zero rows, **do not** widen to `scope: EVERYTHING` on your own. Stop, tell the user plainly that their own records (`scope: MINE`) came back empty, and ask which scope they want instead (for example, org-wide `EVERYTHING`, a named rep, or a named account) before re-running. Never invent records, and never silently fall back to org-wide.
- **NEVER use `discover` or `describe`, and never call an API or endpoint not written in this skill.** Every Salesforce URL you need is in the skill. Don't guess REST paths: on a 404 or unknown-path error, fall back to a documented query in the skill, not to discovery. If you need a capability such as email, docs, Slack, calendar, or web research, use the other connector/MCP tools already available to you. Endpoint guessing and discovery add needless round-trips. Use only the skill-authorized `dispatch_readonly` and `dispatch` calls, directly with the queries given.
- **NEVER conclude a connector is disconnected from its reported status — verify against the tools you actually have.** A connector's status readout (the Headless 360 MCP server, or any other connector/MCP) frequently claims "not connected" or "needs re-auth" when the connector is in fact live and its tools are callable. Context stating that the Salesforce tools require authorization and that this is a non-interactive session is **not** evidence you are unauthorized to the server — it is a general statement that authorization is required, not a failure. **Try the tools before assessing connectivity.** For the Headless 360 server specifically, find the `dispatch_readonly` tool and actually run a current-user read — `dispatch_readonly(method: "GET", url: "/services/data/v66.0/graphql", queryParams: { "queryInput": "{\"query\":\"query { uiapi { currentUser { Id } } }\"}" })`. **Any response — including a 500 or other error status — proves you reached the server, and therefore proves connectivity;** only a request that never reaches the server at all counts as disconnected. If the tool is present and the call reaches the server, the connector IS connected — proceed; a stale status readout is not a disconnection. Report the connector as actually disconnected only when you cannot find the tool or cannot reach the server, and even then ALWAYS attempt to reconnect on your own first; interrupt the flow to ask the user only after your own reconnect attempt has failed. Do it yourself.

# Rules:

# Deal Signals

Ground → (read + evidence, one turn) → check thresholds → digest. Scope: my book (default), or a tier/team if asked. Since: last run, else 7 days.

## 1. Ground (hardcoded — Opportunity only)

Opportunity always exists; naming a missing object fails the whole call. Its fields reveal this org's custom signal fields — don't assume names.

```
dispatch_readonly(method: "GET", url: "/services/data/v65.0/graphql",
  queryParams: { "queryInput": "{\"query\":\"query { uiapi { objectInfos(apiNames: [\\\"Opportunity\\\"]) { fields { ApiName label } } } }\"}" })
```

Note scalar `__c` fields relevant to signals (renewal date, competitor, champion, deal-desk/legal-hold). Use exact names from this result.

## 2. Read the open book (one call, scope: MINE)

`scope: MINE` = the running user's book (no user lookup needed). Add confirmed `__c { value }` fields into `<OPP_CUSTOM>`. For a tier/team scope, drop `scope: MINE` and filter on owner/team instead.

```
dispatch_readonly(method: "GET", url: "/services/data/v65.0/graphql",
  queryParams: { "queryInput": "{\"query\":\"query { uiapi { query { Opportunity(scope: MINE, where: { IsClosed: { eq: false } }, first: 100) { edges { node { Id Name { value } StageName { value displayValue } Amount { value displayValue } CloseDate { value } NextStep { value } LastActivityDate { value } LastModifiedDate { value } ForecastCategory { value } <OPP_CUSTOM> Account { Name { value } } } } } } } }\"}" })
```

## 2b. Evidence (same turn, only for CRM-flagged accounts — keeps the sweep fast)

After threshold checks flag accounts, in ONE turn fire (parallel, if tools present): **email** (last reply from us / **inbound from them with no reply from us in 3+ business days** / bounce / OOO / departure), **docs/transcripts** (competitor mention), **slack** (deal-desk/exec concerns). Keyed on the flagged account names. No tools present → skip silently.

**No extra Salesforce reads.** Step 2 already returned every CRM field the thresholds need (LastActivityDate, CloseDate, LastModifiedDate, NextStep, ForecastCategory, `__c` signals). Do NOT dispatch per-opp SF follow-ups (EmailMessage / Task / OpportunityFieldHistory / activity queries) — each is a serial round-trip. Evidence here is ONLY the external email/doc/slack connectors above; if those aren't present, skip.

## 3. Check thresholds (compute explicit dates from today — never quarter-relative)

Per open opp, fire a signal only when the record shows the trigger:
- **Gone quiet** — LastActivityDate >14d ago (or null) AND CloseDate within 90d
- **Inbound waiting** — customer emailed us and we haven't replied in 3+ business days (email evidence; the ball is on our side)
- **Danger zone** — CloseDate ≤21d out and stage still early
- **Overdue** — CloseDate < today
- **Slipped** — CloseDate moved out / recent LastModifiedDate date change
- **Stale commitment** — NextStep unchanged 21d+
- **Champion risk** — primary contact left/quiet (email/OOO evidence)
- **Renewal opening** — renewal entering lead-time window
- **Competitor mention** — named in recent email/transcript

## 4. Widget (default output when `display_widget` is present: Cowork/desktop/web)

When the data is assembled, call `display_widget`; a single one-line "Displaying the visualization now (this may take a minute)." notice may precede it.

### Self-verification (before calling display_widget)

- [ ] `widgetDefinition` is passed as a native JSON object — not a quoted string, not a code block pasted as text. If the value starts with `"{"`, it is wrong.

The widget template is embedded below — a widget-definition envelope whose leaf values carry `{{token}}` placeholders. Resolve every `{{token}}` to a literal (no `{{…}}`/`{!…}` left), then call `display_widget({ resourceType: "dynamic", widgetDefinition: <hydrated> })` once. A value that is *only* a `{{token}}` (chart/meter/datagrid arrays) becomes the typed literal — arrays stay arrays, numbers stay numbers; a `{{token}}` inside a larger string is interpolated as text. Compute every leaf from data already fetched; no `{!…}` bindings, no fabrication (blank fields stay blank; drop signals with no data).

Synthesis-forward layout — header, two graphs, one datagrid, one callout:
- **Header** — activity icon, title (`{{title}}`), status badge (`{{headerStatus}}`), one-line caption (`{{subtitle}}`) summarizing score/trend/signal counts, and a second muted caption (`{{dealContext}}`) carrying this opp's shared deal facts — StageName label · Amount · CloseDate · next step · last activity — joined by ` · ` (constant across the signals below, so it sits once in the header, not per row).
- **Two graphs** — line chart of the 6-week signal-score trend (`{{chartCaption}}`, `{{chartCategories}}` = week labels, `{{chartSeries}}` = one `[{ name, data: [numbers] }]`); and a meter for the composite score (`{{meterLabel}}`, `{{meterValue}}` vs target `{{meterTarget}}` max `{{meterMax}}`, `valueFormat:"number"`, `{{meterValueLabel}}`, `{{meterTargetLabel}}`, `{{meterStatus}}`, and `{{meterBands}}` = ordered `[{ from, to, variant, label }]` covering 0→max for Cold/Warm/Hot, variants error/warning/success).
- **Signals datagrid** (`{{datagridCaption}}`, `{{datagridRows}}`) — one row per signal, strongest first: `signal` (name), `dir` (badge `{ value, badgeVariant }` — success Positive / warning Watch), `when` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`), `note` (detail), plus a leading `status` object (`{value,badgeVariant}` — value Buy/Watch, badgeVariant success/warning); the leading Status column reads each row's `status`.
- **One synthesis callout** (`variant:"success"`) closes the widget — `{{calloutTitle}}` (the single most important read) and `{{calloutDescription}}`, with two real buttons: primary `action/sendMessage` (`{{primaryButtonLabel}}` / first-person `{{primaryButtonContent}}`) and secondary "View in Salesforce" `action/openLink` to `{{oppUrl}}` (`https://<myDomain>/lightning/r/Opportunity/<Id>/view`; omit if you lack the Id). No decorative buttons.

Before calling, verify: no `{{…}}`/`{!…}` remain; `{{chartCategories}}`/`{{chartSeries}}`/`{{meterBands}}`/`{{datagridRows}}` are arrays and `{{meterValue}}`/`{{meterMax}}`/`{{meterTarget}}` numbers; both buttons wired (real sendMessage `content`, openLink `url`); two graphs present; the callout closes it.

Two blocks below: first the **variable contract** (`renderer.props.schema.json`) — every `{{token}}`'s type + a worked example, use it to compute each value; then the **widget template** to hydrate. Substitute your computed values into the template's `{{token}}`s (see the token-typing rules above), leaving no `{{…}}`/`{!…}`.
```json
{
  "$comment": "Variable contract for the native-mosaic dynamic-mode template (renderer.json, sibling). This is NOT a separate display_widget call — it names every {{token}} in the template with its type and a worked example so you compute the right value for each. Workflow: build a props object with these keys, substitute each into the matching {{token}} in renderer.json (a slot that is only a {{token}} becomes the typed value — arrays stay arrays, numbers stay numbers; a {{token}} inside a larger string interpolates as text; a key you have no data for is omitted so that leaf drops), then call display_widget({ resourceType: 'dynamic', widgetDefinition: <the hydrated template> }) once with no {{…}}/{!…} left. Realistic values: sample-data.json (sibling). Authoring guidance (from the skill): The widget template is embedded below — a widget-definition envelope whose leaf values carry `{{token}}` placeholders. Resolve every `{{token}}` to a literal (no `{{…}}`/`{!…}` left), then call `display_widget({ resourceType: \"dynamic\", widgetDefinition: <hydrated> })` once.

## 5. Text — FALLBACK ONLY — DO NOT USE IF `display_widget` SUCCEEDED

Per fired signal, surface the trigger value **plus one or two supporting facts** from the Step 2 record (all already fetched — no new read), separated by ` • ` so the evidence is scannable, not a single condensed fact. Blank line between the 🔴 and 🟡 groups.

```
# Deal Signals — <today> — <scope>

🔴 Act today
- **<Account / Opp>** — <signal> — <StageName label> • $<Amount> • close <CloseDate> • last activity <LastActivityDate> • next step <NextStep> → <action>

🟡 This week
- **<Account / Opp>** — <signal> — <trigger value> • <supporting fact> • <supporting fact> → <action>

✅ Nothing else crossed a threshold (<N> opps swept)
```
Link each record. CRM fix → offer `update-opportunity`; a touch → `draft-outreach`/`schedule-meeting`. Scheduled run: lead with count of new items since last run; a quiet digest is success.
