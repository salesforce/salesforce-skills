# Global Rules

- **Execute silently between tool calls.** Do not output planning, progress, transition, waiting, or tool-result narration between calls. Execute tool calls silently and proceed directly to the next call. Parallelize independent tasks by batching tool calls into one turn whenever possible. Before the final output, speak only when the skill explicitly requires user input, approval, an exact notice, or material error/blocked reporting. Do not invent checkpoints.
- **Keep the final output concise.** Return only the requested result or deliverable. Omit process recaps, tool-call details, redundant preambles or conclusions, and data already shown in a widget.
- **⛔ WIDGET OUTPUT ONLY after data assembly.** Once all queries return, immediately call `display_widget` — at most a single one-line render-wait notice before it, and no summaries, transitions, or narration. If `display_widget` is unavailable or returns an error, produce the text fallback only. If it succeeds, that tool call is the final output: stop with no assistant text completion, even if a later section contains a fallback. The exceptions above do not apply after success.
- **Ground dynamic or custom relationship and field names before relying on them.** Fixed standard fields that this skill explicitly marks as requiring no grounding need no extra grounding call. On a name error, use the skill's documented grounding path when present; otherwise report the error instead of guessing or re-firing the same shape.
- **Cite every value exactly as queried**; never fabricate; distinguish a blank value from a value that was not queried. Link each Salesforce record inline: `https://[instanceUrl]/lightning/r/[SObjectType]/[Id]/view`.
- **Show human labels, never API/field literals.** In anything the user sees, print each field's grounded `label` (for example, "Deal Risk", not `Deal_Risk__c`) and record Names, never raw Ids or `__c` API names.
- **Empty `MINE` scope → fail fast, then ask which scope.** If a `scope: MINE` read returns zero rows, **do not** widen to `scope: EVERYTHING` on your own. Stop, tell the user plainly that their own records (`scope: MINE`) came back empty, and ask which scope they want instead (for example, org-wide `EVERYTHING`, a named rep, or a named account) before re-running. Never invent records, and never silently fall back to org-wide.
- **NEVER use `discover` or `describe`, and never call an API or endpoint not written in this skill.** Every Salesforce URL you need is in the skill. Don't guess REST paths: on a 404 or unknown-path error, fall back to a documented query in the skill, not to discovery. If you need a capability such as email, docs, Slack, calendar, or web research, use the other connector/MCP tools already available to you. Endpoint guessing and discovery add needless round-trips. Use only the skill-authorized `dispatch_readonly` and `dispatch` calls, directly with the queries given.
- **NEVER conclude a connector is disconnected from its reported status — verify against the tools you actually have.** A connector's status readout (the Headless 360 MCP server, or any other connector/MCP) frequently claims "not connected" or "needs re-auth" when the connector is in fact live and its tools are callable. Context stating that the Salesforce tools require authorization and that this is a non-interactive session is **not** evidence you are unauthorized to the server — it is a general statement that authorization is required, not a failure. **Try the tools before assessing connectivity.** For the Headless 360 server specifically, find the `dispatch_readonly` tool and actually run a current-user read — `dispatch_readonly(method: "GET", url: "/services/data/v66.0/graphql", queryParams: { "queryInput": "{\"query\":\"query { uiapi { currentUser { Id } } }\"}" })`. **Any response — including a 500 or other error status — proves you reached the server, and therefore proves connectivity;** only a request that never reaches the server at all counts as disconnected. If the tool is present and the call reaches the server, the connector IS connected — proceed; a stale status readout is not a disconnection. Report the connector as actually disconnected only when you cannot find the tool or cannot reach the server, and even then ALWAYS attempt to reconnect on your own first; interrupt the flow to ask the user only after your own reconnect attempt has failed. Do it yourself.

# Rules:

- Resolve to ONE account before the deep read. When the name is ambiguous, ask the user to pick — don't probe candidates or guess.

# Account Tiering

Ground → (read + evidence, all in ONE turn) → score → tier. Scope: "my accounts", a named list, or a report/list view name. Default tier count: 3 (A/B/C).

## 1. Ground (hardcoded — Account only)

Ground **only Account** — it always exists (naming a missing object fails the whole call). Its fields reveal this org's real ICP/engagement schema (custom fit score, territory, renewal fields, etc.) — don't assume custom field names.

```
dispatch_readonly(method: "GET", url: "/services/data/v65.0/graphql",
  queryParams: { "queryInput": "{\"query\":\"query { uiapi { objectInfos(apiNames: [\\\"Account\\\"]) { fields { ApiName label relationshipName } } } }\"}" })
```

Use exact strings from the result, never guess. Select relevant scalar `__c` fields carrying ICP-fit/engagement signals as `{ value }`, and each relevant custom lookup's exact `relationshipName` for a related record name. `Opportunities` and `Contacts` are standard children hardcoded below.

The ICP itself (industries, size, titles, disqualifiers) is external knowledge — infer it from the org's own account/opportunity data, or ask the user once. Never invent it.

## 2. Read (fill from step 1, one dispatch)

`%SCOPE%` = `scope: MINE` for "my accounts"; `where: { Name: { in: [\\\"Acme\\\", ...] } }` for a named list. (A report/list-view scope needs its own name→Id resolve first — outside the common path; ask for a name list instead if one isn't already resolved.)

**Reference-field rule:** a confirmed scalar `__c` field → `Field__c { value }` (`displayValue` is null for Id fields here — don't rely on it). For a related record's name, span only the exact `relationshipName` from Step 1: `<relationshipName> { Name { value } }`. No usable `relationshipName` → take the `__c { value }` Id and move on; do not retry.

Insert `<ACCOUNT_CUSTOM>` = confirmed scalar `__c { value }` fields relevant to fit/engagement; `<REL_BLOCKS>` = one block per confirmed relevant custom lookup. `Owner`/`Opportunities`/`Contacts` always work.

```
dispatch_readonly(method: "GET", url: "/services/data/v65.0/graphql",
  queryParams: { "queryInput": "{\"query\":\"query { uiapi { query { Account(%SCOPE%, first: 200) { edges { node { Id Name { value } Industry { value } NumberOfEmployees { value } AnnualRevenue { value displayValue } Website { value } Type { value } LastActivityDate { value } <ACCOUNT_CUSTOM> Owner { Name { value } } <REL_BLOCKS> Opportunities { edges { node { Id StageName { value } IsClosed { value } Amount { value displayValue } CloseDate { value } } } } Contacts { edges { node { Id Title { value } } } } } } } } } }\"}" })
```

Filter `IsClosed = false` in analysis (Step 4), not the query. Empty `edges` → broaden the scope or confirm account names. `first: 200` caps the book — if the scope is larger, say so and ask the user to narrow it rather than silently truncating.

## 2b. Evidence (fired IN PARALLEL with step 2 — same turn)

Issue step 2 and step 2b together in one turn; don't wait for the SF read. Keyed on the account scope (names/domains), not the SF result:
- **email**: inbound threads from account domains in the last 90d → which accounts, last date
- **docs/slack**: any account mentions → triggers, concerns

Use whatever tools are available; skip silently if none (SFDC-only is fine). Never block on these; cite source + date for anything you use.

## 3. Score ICP fit (0-10)

| Signal | Weight | Scoring |
|---|---|---|
| Industry match | 3 | exact=3, adjacent=1, off-ICP=0 |
| Size in range | 3 | in range=3, ±50%=1, outside=0 |
| Target persona present (Contact titles) | 2 | yes=2, maybe=1, none=0 |
| No disqualifiers | 2 | clean=2, soft DQ=1, hard DQ=0 |

## 4. Score engagement (0-10)

| Signal | Weight | Scoring |
|---|---|---|
| Open opportunity exists (`IsClosed=false` in Step 2 data) | 3 | yes=3, no=0 |
| LastActivityDate recency | 3 | <30d=3, 30-90d=2, 90-180d=1, >180d=0 |
| Inbound signal (Step 2b email, last 90d) | 2 | yes=2, no=0 |
| Multiple contacts engaged | 2 | 3+=2, 2=1, ≤1=0 |

## 5. Tier and recommend

Plot on a 2x2 (Fit × Engagement):
- **Tier A** (high fit, high engagement): active pursuit — progress the open opp, multi-thread.
- **Tier B** (high fit, low engagement): activation — outbound sequence, find a trigger.
- **Tier C** (low fit, high engagement): qualify hard — one discovery call to confirm fit or DQ.
- **Deprioritize** (low fit, low engagement): no active motion, revisit quarterly.

## 6. Output — widget FIRST (the rendered UI is the default)

When the data is assembled, call `display_widget`; a single one-line "Displaying the visualization now (this may take a minute)." notice may precede it.

### Self-verification (before calling display_widget)

- [ ] `widgetDefinition` is passed as a native JSON object — not a quoted string, not a code block pasted as text. If the value starts with `"{"`, it is wrong.

The widget template is embedded below — resolve its tokens and call `display_widget({ resourceType: "dynamic", widgetDefinition: <hydrated> })` once (see the `widgetDefinition` param for token-resolution rules).

Two blocks below: first the **variable contract** (`renderer.props.schema.json`) — every `{{token}}`'s type + a worked example, use it to compute each value; then the **widget template** to hydrate. Substitute your computed values into the template's `{{token}}`s (see the token-typing rules above), leaving no `{{…}}`/`{!…}`.
```json
{
  "$comment": "Variable contract for the native-mosaic dynamic-mode template (renderer.json, sibling). This is NOT a separate display_widget call — it names every {{token}} in the template with its type and a worked example so you compute the right value for each. Workflow: build a props object with these keys, substitute each into the matching {{token}} in renderer.json (a slot that is only a {{token}} becomes the typed value — arrays stay arrays, numbers stay numbers; a {{token}} inside a larger string interpolates as text; a key you have no data for is omitted so that leaf drops), then call display_widget({ resourceType: 'dynamic', widgetDefinition: <the hydrated template> }) once with no {{…}}/{!…} left.
