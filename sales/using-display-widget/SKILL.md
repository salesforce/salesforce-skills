  How to render a rich UI with the `display_widget` tool. Two modes: "dynamic",
  where YOU (the agent) author the widget definition directly and the
  server echoes it to the native renderer; and "salesforce_widget", where you name a pre-registered
  widget by its widget_resource_uri (a ui://widget/lightningType/c__TypeName resource URI) and
  pass its props and the server builds the widget definition. Covers when to call display_widget vs. plain text, dynamic vs. salesforce_widget, the
  exact widget-definition renderer-envelope structure, the tile-block vocabulary (text, card, row/column, table,
  list, badge, callout, link, separator, markdown, etc.) with their attributes and enum values,
  and the rules that keep a widget from rendering blank (hydrated literals only — no {!…}
  expressions; tile/text uses `text` not `content`; children compose at the mosaic layer). Use
  when a skill or task wants to present assembled Salesforce data as a styled widget rather than
  a wall of text.

# Global Rules

- **Execute silently between tool calls.** Do not output planning, progress, transition, waiting, or tool-result narration between calls. Execute tool calls silently and proceed directly to the next call. Parallelize independent tasks by batching tool calls into one turn whenever possible. Before the final output, speak only when the skill explicitly requires user input, approval, an exact notice, or material error/blocked reporting. Do not invent checkpoints.
- **Keep the final output concise.** Return only the requested result or deliverable. Omit process recaps, tool-call details, redundant preambles or conclusions, and data already shown in a widget.
- **Ground dynamic or custom relationship and field names before relying on them.** Fixed standard fields that this skill explicitly marks as requiring no grounding need no extra grounding call. On a name error, use the skill's documented grounding path when present; otherwise report the error instead of guessing or re-firing the same shape.
- **Cite every value exactly as queried**; never fabricate; distinguish a blank value from a value that was not queried. Link each Salesforce record inline: `https://[instanceUrl]/lightning/r/[SObjectType]/[Id]/view`.
- **Show human labels, never API/field literals.** In anything the user sees, print each field's grounded `label` (for example, "Deal Risk", not `Deal_Risk__c`) and record Names, never raw Ids or `__c` API names.
- **Empty `MINE` scope → fail fast, then ask which scope.** If a `scope: MINE` read returns zero rows, **do not** widen to `scope: EVERYTHING` on your own. Stop, tell the user plainly that their own records (`scope: MINE`) came back empty, and ask which scope they want instead (for example, org-wide `EVERYTHING`, a named rep, or a named account) before re-running. Never invent records, and never silently fall back to org-wide.
- **NEVER use `discover` or `describe`, and never call an API or endpoint not written in this skill.** Every Salesforce URL you need is in the skill. Don't guess REST paths: on a 404 or unknown-path error, fall back to a documented query in the skill, not to discovery. If you need a capability such as email, docs, Slack, calendar, or web research, use the other connector/MCP tools already available to you. Endpoint guessing and discovery add needless round-trips. Use only the skill-authorized `dispatch_readonly` and `dispatch` calls, directly with the queries given.
- **NEVER assume the MCP connector status is accurate without checking first**; MCP connector status often incorrectly reports that it is not connected or needs to re auth. ALWAYS check this on your own before surfacing to the user for action. ALWAYS attempt to reconnect on your own before interrupting the flow to ask the user to do it. Do it yourself.

# Using `display_widget`

`display_widget` renders a widget from a **widget definition** using the native
Salesforce renderer. The production Headless 360 MCP exposes the tool; the standalone local
`salesforce-ui` MCP provides the equivalent contract for development. In
`dynamic` mode you author the widget definition yourself and the server echoes it straight to
the renderer — this is how an agent presents its own assembled UI. In
`salesforce_widget` mode you instead name a **pre-registered** widget and pass it data;
the server builds the widget definition. Most of this skill covers `dynamic` (authoring the definition);
`salesforce_widget` needs no widget-definition knowledge — just a `widget_resource_uri` and `props`.

Reach for `display_widget` whenever you want a **composed, styled layout** — a
summary card, a dashboard, a mixed text+table+badge view — instead of a wall of
text.

## When to call it

Gather first, render once. Do all your `dispatch` work, assemble the finished
picture, then call `display_widget` a single time to present it. The widget
reflects completed work, not one intermediate query.

- Use it in clients that mount MCP Apps widgets (Cowork, Claude Desktop, web).
- In a terminal (Claude Code), the widget won't mount — the tool's text
  fallback is shown instead, so always keep the text content meaningful.

## Calling it

Two modes; `resourceType` is required (pick one):

```jsonc
// dynamic — you author the widget definition (this skill's focus)
display_widget({
  "resourceType": "dynamic",
  "widgetDefinition": { /* the renderer envelope you authored — see below */ }
})

// salesforce_widget — a pre-registered widget builds its own definition from your data
display_widget({
  "resourceType": "salesforce_widget",
  "widget_resource_uri": "ui://widget/lightningType/c__helloWorld",
  "props": { "text": "Hello, World" }
})
```

- `resourceType: "dynamic"` — you author the widget definition; the server echoes it back. Use
  this for a composed, styled layout the pre-registered widgets don't cover.
- `resourceType: "salesforce_widget"` — name a **pre-registered** widget by its
  `widget_resource_uri` (a lightning-type resource URI,
  `ui://widget/lightningType/c__<typeName>` — the identifier Core returns at
  runtime) and pass its `props` (the field values); the server builds the definition for
  you. Use this when a registered widget already matches what you want to show —
  you supply data, not layout. In production, Core builds this definition from the widget's
  Lightning Types resource. The standalone local server stands in with a fixed set of local
  builders (`c__helloWorld`, the minimal demo, and a few sales
  widgets) — author anything richer via `dynamic` mode.
  An unknown `widget_resource_uri` errors and names the registered set.
- There is no no-arg mode. For a quick demo, render the `c__helloWorld` widget:
  `display_widget({ "resourceType": "salesforce_widget", "widget_resource_uri":
  "ui://widget/lightningType/c__helloWorld" })`.

The result carries the widget definition in `_meta["salesforce/uiMetadata"]`, which the native
renderer reads via `accessToolMetadata` to paint the tree. The same definition is mirrored into
`structuredContent.widgetDefinition` (matching Core's `display_widget`, so the caller and the
renderer's structuredContent fallback can both read it); the text `content` is the
fallback for hosts that never mount the iframe.

## Widget-definition structure

The widget definition is a **declarative renderer envelope**. The renderer reads
`renderer.componentOverrides.$`, which is a `tile/mosaic` root whose `children`
are the tile blocks to render, in order:

```jsonc
{
  "renderer": {
    "componentOverrides": {
      "$": {
        "type": "mosaic",
        "definition": "tile/mosaic",
        "children": [
          /* tile blocks, rendered top to bottom */
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Every block is:

```jsonc
{
  "definition": "tile/<name>",   // e.g. "tile/text"
  "attributes": { /* block-specific props */ },
  "children": [ /* nested blocks, for layout/container blocks */ ]
}
```

The server also accepts a few shorthands and wraps them into this envelope for
you: a bare `tile/mosaic` root, a plain array of blocks, or a single block. Prefer
authoring the full envelope — it's unambiguous.

### Two rules that keep it from rendering blank

1. **Author fully-hydrated literals.** Put real values in `attributes`
   (`"text": "Acme Corp"`), not Mosaic expressions. This echo path does **no**
   compilation — `{!$record.Name}`-style bindings are not resolved and unhydrated
   `{!…}` attribute values are stripped before render. Resolve your data in the
   agent, then write the final strings/numbers into the widget definition.
2. **Use each block's real attribute name.** Notably `tile/text` takes `text`
   (not `content` or `value`), `tile/badge` takes `label`, `tile/markdown` takes
   `source`. See the vocabulary below.

## Tile-block vocabulary

Attributes are optional unless marked **required**. Enum values are the full set.

### Content

- **`tile/text`** — `text` (**required**), `variant` (`body`|`caption`|`code`|`h1`–`h6`),
  `weight` (`normal`|`medium`|`semibold`|`bold`), `color`
  (`default`|`error`|`muted`|`primary`|`success`|`warning`), `isItalic`,
  `isStrikethrough`.
- **`tile/markdown`** — `source` (**required**): a markdown string. Use for
  multi-paragraph or formatted prose.
- **`tile/badge`** — `label` (**required**), `variant`
  (`primary`|`secondary`|`outline`|`info`|`success`|`warning`|`error`). A small
  status pill.
- **`tile/link`** — `href` (**required**), `text`, `variant`
  (`default`|`muted`|`primary`), `underline` (`always`|`hover`|`none`).
- **`tile/callout`** — `title` (**required**), `description`, `variant`
  (`default`|`error`|`info`|`note`|`success`|`tip`|`warning`). A boxed notice.
- **`tile/separator`** — `orientation` (`horizontal`|`vertical`). A divider rule.

### Layout / containers (use `children`)

- **`tile/card`** — a bordered/elevated panel. `variant`
  (`default`|`elevated`|`outlined`), `padding`, `width`, `maxWidth`. Put content
  blocks in `children`.
- **`tile/column`** — vertical stack. `gap` (`none`|`xs`|`sm`|`md`|`lg`|`xl`,
  default `md`), `align`, `width`. Children in `children`.
- **`tile/row`** — horizontal layout. `gap` (same tokens), `align`, `justify`
  (`start`|`center`|`end`|`between`|`around`|`evenly`), `isWrapped`.
- **`tile/list`** — `marker` (`none`|`bullet`|`number`); `children` are
  `tile/listitem` blocks.
- **`tile/listitem`** — no attributes; compose its `children` from `tile/text`,
  `tile/link`, `tile/badge`, etc.

### Table

- **`tile/table`** — `columns` (**required**), `rows` (**required**), `caption`
  (**required**), `appearance` (`default`|`bordered`|`striped`), `size`
  (`sm`|`md`), `isStickyHeader`.
  - `columns`: ordered array of `{ "key", "header", "align"? }`. `align` is
    `left` (default) | `center` | `right` (right-align numbers). `key` matches a
    property name in each row.
  - `rows`: array of objects; each object's keys match column `key`s. **All cell
    values are strings** — format numbers/dates into display-ready strings
    yourself (e.g. `"$4,200,000"`, `"2026-07-01"`). Missing keys render empty.

Other available blocks (same `{definition, attributes, children}` shape):
`tile/image`, `tile/icon`, `tile/avatar`, `tile/button`, `tile/code`,
`tile/progress`, `tile/spinner`, `tile/spacer`, `tile/container`,
`tile/accordion` + `tile/accordionitem`, and the form inputs (`tile/textfield`,
`tile/textarea`, `tile/numberfield`, `tile/select`, `tile/checkbox`,
`tile/radio`, `tile/switch`). Form inputs only do something useful in a host that
wires their events; for a read-only presentation, stick to the content/layout
blocks above.

### Data visualization

These tiles turn resolved numbers into charts. Two rules carry over: author
**hydrated literals** (numbers stay numbers here — unlike `tile/table`, whose
cells are all strings), and give every viz a `caption` — it is the accessible
description and the text-fallback line. `valueFormat` (where present) is
`number` | `percent` | `currency` | `compact`; `size` (where present) is
`sm` | `md` | `lg`. Values are labelled on the marks, so the read never rests on
color alone.

- **`tile/chart`** — `chartType` (**required**, `bar`|`line`|`area`|`column`),
  `categories` (**required**, `string[]` — the x-axis), `series` (**required**,
  array of `{ name, data: (number|null)[], type? }`; `type` per-series overrides
  `chartType` for combos), `caption` (**required**). Optional: `stackMode`
  (`none`|`stacked`|`normalized`), `baseline` (`zero`|`center`), `valueFormat`,
  `showValues`, `showLegend`, `showGrid`, `title`, `xAxisLabel`, `yAxisLabel`,
  `size`. Use for multi-point/multi-series comparison.
- **`tile/sparkline`** — `data` (**required**, `(number|null)[]`), `label`
  (**required**). Optional: `variant` (`line`|`bar`|`area`), `baseline` (number),
  `showEndpoint`, `highlightExtremes`, `valueFormat`, `role`
  (`neutral`|`positive`|`negative`|`emphasis`), `size` (`sm`|`md`). A compact
  inline trend for a KPI.
- **`tile/meter`** — `value` (**required**, number), `valueLabel` (**required**,
  the formatted read). Optional: `min` (0), `max` (100), `target` (number),
  `bands` (array of `{ from, to, variant: error|success|info|warning, label }`),
  `label`, `targetLabel`, `status`, `overAttainment`, `orientation`
  (`horizontal`|`vertical`), `size`, `showValue`. A bullet graph for
  goal/attainment.
- **`tile/piechart`** — `slices` (**required**, array of `{ label, value,
  role?: normal|highlight }`), `caption` (**required**). Optional: `variant`
  (`pie`|`donut`), `valueFormat`, `showValues`, `showLegend`, `maxSlices`
  (buckets the rest into "Other"), `centerLabel` + `centerValue` (donut only),
  `size`. Part-to-whole composition.
- **`tile/waterfall`** — `start` (**required**, `{ label, value }`), `steps`
  (**required**, array of `{ label, delta, role?: auto|increase|decrease }`),
  `end` (**required**, `{ label, value? }` — value computed when omitted).
  Optional: `valueFormat` (`number`|`percent`|`currency`), `showConnectors`,
  `showValues`, `caption`, `size`. A running-total bridge; each step is signed.
- **`tile/heatmap`** — `caption` (**required**), `domain` (**required**,
  `[min, max]`). Matrix layout: `xLabels`, `yLabels` (`string[]`) and `cells`
  (array of `{ x, y, value, valueLabel? }`). Calendar layout (`layout:
  "calendar"`): `days` (array of `{ date: "YYYY-MM-DD", value }`). Optional:
  `layout` (`matrix`|`calendar`), `encode` (`color`|`size`), `scale`
  (`sequential`|`diverging`), `midpoint` (diverging), `valueFormat`, `size`.
- **`tile/datagrid`** — a richer `tile/table`: typed, sortable columns and
  per-row status. `caption` (**required**), `columns` (**required**, array of
  `{ key, header, type?, align?, sortable?, width?, priority?, target? }`), `rows`
  (**required**). Column `type`: `text`|`number`|`currency`|`percent`|`date`|
  `datetime`|`boolean`|`link`|`badge`|`avatar`|`rating`|`databar`|`sparkline`.
  Cell values are the **raw typed value** (number for `currency`/`percent`,
  ISO string for `date`, `number[]` for `sparkline`) — the column `type`
  formats them — or an object `{ value, display?, href?, badgeVariant?, tone? }`.
  A row may carry `_status` (a label) + `_tone`
  (`error`|`success`|`info`|`warning`|`default`) to tint the whole row. Optional:
  `defaultSort` (`{ key, direction: asc|desc }`), `footer` (array of `{ key,
  label?, value }`), `appearance`, `size` (`sm`|`md`), `isStickyHeader`,
  `emptyText`, `totalRows`. Reach for it over `tile/table` when you want sorting,
  typed formatting, or risk tinting; use `tile/table` for a plain read-only grid.

## Worked example — an opportunity summary

Data already fetched via `dispatch`, resolved into literals, then rendered once:

```jsonc
display_widget({
  "resourceType": "dynamic",
  "widgetDefinition": {
    "renderer": { "componentOverrides": { "$": {
      "type": "mosaic",
      "definition": "tile/mosaic",
      "children": [
        { "definition": "tile/card", "attributes": { "variant": "elevated", "padding": "lg" },
          "children": [
            { "definition": "tile/row", "attributes": { "justify": "between", "align": "center" },
              "children": [
                { "definition": "tile/text", "attributes": { "text": "Acme Corp — Renewal", "variant": "h3" } },
                { "definition": "tile/badge", "attributes": { "label": "Proposal", "variant": "info" } }
              ] },
            { "definition": "tile/text", "attributes": { "text": "$4,200,000 · closes 2026-09-30", "variant": "body", "color": "muted" } },
            { "definition": "tile/separator" },
            { "definition": "tile/table",
              "attributes": {
                "caption": "Open opportunities",
                "appearance": "striped",
                "columns": [
                  { "key": "name",   "header": "Name" },
                  { "key": "stage",  "header": "Stage" },
                  { "key": "amount", "header": "Amount", "align": "right" }
                ],
                "rows": [
                  { "name": "Big Deal",    "stage": "Prospecting", "amount": "$100,000" },
                  { "name": "Bigger Deal", "stage": "Closed Won",  "amount": "$500,000" }
                ]
              } }
          ] }
      ]
    } } }
  }
})
```

## Text fallback

Always author the tool's text `content` to carry the same information as the
widget (the tool does this from your widget definition's block text automatically, but the
richer the blocks' `text`/`label`/`title`, the better the fallback). In a
terminal or a host that advertises MCP Apps but never mounts the iframe, the text
is all the user sees — it must stand on its own, not say "rendered a widget."
